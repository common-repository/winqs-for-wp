qbeats for WordPress lets you turn more readers into more revenue.


== Description ==

qbeats has created a turnkey plugin for WordPress.org users to get paid for their craft. With qbeats plugin you can turn any story into a premium piece, accessible to your users with cash pay or ad view through qbeats’ PayWindowTM. You send select content to our platform for parsing and pricing and we pass it back to you priced and ready for sale on your site and handle the e-commerce transaction. Your readers can purchase the content with their qbeats wallet or watch an ad, if available, in lieu of paying cash.

Our proprietary QMVTM technology assigns real-time, fair market value to content by factoring in dozens of variables such as demand, relevance, timeliness, exclusivity and journalist ratings. Because the value of your content changes dynamically over time, your readers know they're paying a fair price while you know you are being correctly compensated for your work.
